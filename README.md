## Background

Sorting is a critical operation in computer science, used extensively in data organization and retrieval. From simple O(n^2) algorithms like Bubble Sort to more sophisticated O(n log(n)) algorithms like Merge Sort, this project explores a range of sorting techniques, each with its unique characteristics and efficiencies.

## Implementation Details

**Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Implementation of various sorting algorithms, each catering to different data sizes and sorting requirements.

**Custom Comparator Support**: Each sorting algorithm supports a custom comparator to define the order of sorting, enhancing flexibility.

**Hybrid Sorting Approach**: Implementation of a hybrid sorting algorithm that combines the efficiency of Merge Sort for larger datasets with the speed of Insertion Sort for smaller subsets.

**Efficiency and Optimization**: The sorting algorithms are optimized for different scenarios, from handling small datasets quickly to managing large datasets efficiently.

**Application Problem**: Maximizing Rewards for Conrad's Restaurant


**Problem Statement**: Develop an algorithm to pair up food orders in such a way that maximizes the total reward points, calculated by multiplying the prices of two items in each pair.

**Sorting Algorithm Application**: Utilization of the most efficient sorting algorithm from the implemented set to organize the food items' prices and pair them optimally.

**Output**: The algorithm outputs a list of item price pairs and the total reward points accumulated.

## Key Features

**Versatile Sorting Options**: A range of sorting algorithms allows for tailored approaches to different sorting challenges.

**Practical Application in Business**: The application problem demonstrates a real-world scenario where sorting algorithms can directly impact business efficiency and customer satisfaction.

**Optimization and Efficiency**: Focus on choosing the most efficient sorting algorithm for the application problem, ensuring optimal performance.
